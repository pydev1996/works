                                          should be based on yield goals and cropping history. Excess nitrogen,
                                          whether applied or residual, may result in lodging. Allow for nitrogen applied as manure
                                          or other waste. Phosphorus and potassium should be applied as needed based on soil recommendations.
                                          Drill row applications of fertilizer (except straight phosphorus fertilizers)
                                          may cause seedling injury and are not recommended. A pH of 5.6 or higher is recommended for millet.
